#Create determinant det function

Create a recursive function that outputs the determinant when a matrix is ​​input to variable A

Created using the determinant formula
For a 2x2 matrix, use ad x bc
In the case of a matrix larger than 2x2, find the location of 0, eliminate 0 first, and then make it into a 2x2 matrix.
